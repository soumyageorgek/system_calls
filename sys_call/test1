a) Demonstrate the working of the "dup" system call

b) Demonstrate the working of the "close" system call. What would
   happen if you try to read from a file descriptor which has been
   closed?

c) Open a file in the parent process; create a child process by
   calling "fork". Can you use the same file descriptor in the
   child also? Experiment.

d) Find out the minimum value of the file descriptor returned by
   "open"? 

e) What will happen if you open a file twice like this:

    int fd1, fd2;

    fd1 = open("abc", O_RDONLY);
    fd2 = open("abc", O_RDONLY);

  experiment with reading from both descriptors. What do you
  observe?

f) Is there any limit on the number of times you can call "open"
   in a program. Find out experimentally.

g) Three file descriptors - 0, 1, 2 are always "open" by default
   in a C program. Experiment and find out more about the utility
   of these descriptors.

h) Find out how "lseek" works by writing one or two small test
   programs.
