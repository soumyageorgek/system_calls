Those who are doing systems stuff:

Please write small programs to understand the working of the following syscalls:

a) fork

b) exec  (exec is a family of calls: there are calls like execle, execlp etc ... try any one)

c) open, read, write, close

d) kill

-------------------------------

Write the following programs:

a) A program which will read a process id from the keyboard and kills that process

b) A program which reads  a process id from the commandline and kills that process

c) A program which reads a file name from the commandline and deletes that file

d) A program which reads a name from the commandline and creates a directory with that name

e) A program which reads a user name from the commandline and prints the user id

f) A simple file copy program using open/read/write sys calls


A bit more advanced stuff
---------------------------------------

a) Study the working of the "dup" syscall. How does it help you implement I/O redirection

b) Study the working of the "signal" function.

 
Please create a github repo and push the code that you write.

Please make sure that you finish these exercises by Monday.

Once you finish these, you can start studying the "ptrace" call.
